## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 16+ 
- A GitHub account
- A Giphy API key (optional - falls back to public beta key)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/commit-gifly.git
cd commit-gifly
npm install
```

### 2. Create a GitHub App

1. Go to GitHub Settings → Developer settings → GitHub Apps
2. Click "New GitHub App"
3. Fill in the required information:
   - **App name**: `Your Bot Name`
   - **Homepage URL**: `https://your-domain.com` (or GitHub repo URL)
   - **Webhook URL**: `https://your-domain.com/webhook`
   - **Webhook secret**: Generate a random string
   - **Permissions**:
     - Issues: Read & Write
     - Pull requests: Read & Write
     - Metadata: Read
   - **Subscribe to events**:
     - Issue comments
     - Pull request review comments
4. Create the app and note down the **App ID**
5. Generate and download a **private key**

### 3. Get a Giphy API Key (Optional)

1. Visit [Giphy Developers](https://developers.giphy.com/)
2. Create an account and get your API key
3. The app will work with the public beta key if you don't provide one

### 4. Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```env
PORT=3000
APP_ID=your_github_app_id
GIPHY_API_KEY=your_giphy_api_key
WEBHOOK_SECRET=your_webhook_secret
PRIVATE_KEY_PATH=./private-key.pem
```

Place your GitHub App's private key file as `private-key.pem` in the project root.

### 5. Run the Application

```bash
# Development
npm run dev

# Production
npm start
```

The server will start on the specified port with these endpoints:
- `GET /` - Basic app information
- `GET /health` - Health check
- `POST /webhook` - GitHub webhook endpoint

## 📖 Usage

Once your GitHub App is installed on a repository, you can use it by commenting on issues or pull requests:

```
[gifbot:celebration] - Search for celebration GIFs
[gifbot:thumbs up] - Search for thumbs up GIFs
[gifbot:confused] - Search for confused GIFs
[gifbot:coffee] - Search for coffee GIFs
```

The bot will respond with a relevant animated GIF from Giphy!

### Example

**Comment:**
```
This looks great! [gifbot:awesome]
```

**Bot Response:**

## 🐳 Docker Deployment

### Build and Run with Docker

```bash
# Build the image
docker build -t commit-gifly .

# Run the container
docker run -d \
  --name commit-gifly \
  -p 3000:3000 \
  --env-file .env \
  -v $(pwd)/private-key.pem:/app/private-key.pem:ro \
  commit-gifly
```

### Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3.8'
services:
  commit-gifly:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"

      - .env
    volumes:
      - ./private-key.pem:/app/private-key.pem:ro
    restart: unless-stopped
```

## ☁️ Cloud Deployment

### Heroku

1. Create a new Heroku app
2. Set environment variables in Heroku dashboard
